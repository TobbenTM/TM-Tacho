### tm-tacho

This is a somewhat failed project. Reuploaded to share the code. 

It does work to some degree. Client-server communication not tested or optimized.

The problem with controlling tachometers is that it gets a non-linear increase in Hz vs RPM. 

I have since wondered if adjusting the signal will help. IE decrease ON time to ~2ms. 

But I have not done anything with it, and dont plan to at the moment.
